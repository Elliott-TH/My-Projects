## A Problem
---
Everyone knows that there is always some risk when purchasing items off ebay, but when the seller of the chamber I
purchased said it was "tested by a lab tech and working", I belived them. After obtaining it, I soon discovered something
that anyone who handles HV equipment would consider horrific... A hole was drilled directly in the interface between
the 2 ConFlat flanges\
Now, this is a good opportunity to talk about ConFlat flanges and how they are able to maintain such high levels of
vacuum, and why this one small hole is so devastating.\
## Conflat Flanges
ConFlat is the industry standard for vacuum systems due to their properties - With a pressure range from stp all the way down to the ultra high vacuum (UHV) range (10^-8 to 10^-12 torr), as well as having a temperature range from -196 to 450 degrees celcius. Obviously these are some pretty remarkable operating ranges, and they obtain this from their very unique sealing mechanism.\\
Rather than using rubber seals (such as KF flanges) which can't be used in UHV due to unweildy outgassing, ConFlats use a copper ring which is crushed in-between 2 super sharp knife edges. This forms a nearly inpenatrable seal which is able to handle pressures no other joints are able to.
