# The Problem
---
Everyone knows that there is always some risk when purchasing items off ebay, but when the seller of the chamber I
purchased said it was "tested by a lab tech and working", I belived them. After obtaining it, I soon discovered something
that anyone who handles HV equipment would consider horrific... A hole was drilled directly in the interface between
the 2 ConFlat flanges\
Now, this is a good opportunity to talk about ConFlat flanges and how they are able to maintain such high levels of
vacuum, and why this one small hole is so devastating.
